I always thought the 'Add/Remove Programs' feature from Windows was way too slow and was missing a few important features like searching. So I created my own Add/Remove Programs soft.

This a .net WinForms C# application.

  * Version 1.3.1 minor fix
  * Version 1.3 another way of parsing the UnisntallString entry
  * Version 1.2.1 fixes minor issues
  * Version 1.2 improves the way an uninstaller program gets called (we don't parse the arguments anymore)
  * Version 1.1.1 adds a few accelerators (ALT + key)
  * Version 1.1 loads the list in background, making the UI to load faster.
